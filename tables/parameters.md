| **Parameter**                       | **Type**              | **Default**      | **Description** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `input_file` or `i`                 | `str`                 | –                | Path to an input alignment file or a directory containing multiple files. Required unless `CSV_input` is provided. |
| `CSV_input` or `csv`                | `str`                 | –                | Path to a CSV/TSV dataframe with GenBank accession numbers and/or local sequence-file paths. Required unless `input_file` is provided. Cells may contain GenBank multi-amplicons delimited by `/` or `\|`, optionally with manual classification markers: use `(O)` to force overlapping treatment (e.g., `MF624199(O)MF624174`) or `(N)` for non-overlapping treatment (e.g., `MF624199(N)MF624174`). Without markers, classification is automatic. |
| `input_format` or `if`              | `str`                 | `"fasta"`        | Input format, such as `fasta`, `clustal`, `phylip`, or any format accepted by Biopython. |

| `output_format` or `of`             | `str`                 | `"fasta"`        | Output alignment format. |

| `orphan_method` or `om`             | `str`                 | `None`           | Method to handle orphan nucleotides: `integer`, `percentile`, `adaptive_1`, `adaptive_2`, `adaptive_3`, or `None`. |
| `orphan_threshold` or `ot`          | `int`                 | `10`             | Threshold used when `orphan_method='integer'`, and also the maximum dynamic threshold when `orphan_method` is `adaptive_1`, `adaptive_2`, or `adaptive_3`. |
| `orphan_limit` or `ol`              | `float`               | `0.05`           | Modification limit as a fraction of sequence length for adaptive methods (default: 0.05 = 5%). Specifies the maximum proportion of a sequence that can be trimmed or realigned. |
| `orphan_action` or `oa`             | `str`                 | `"trim"`         | Action for orphan nucleotides: `trim` removes them, and `push` moves them adjacent to the next block iteratively. |

| `internal_column_ranges` or `g2q_c` | `list` or `str`       | `"all"`          | Column ranges in Python list format for `internal_method='manual'`. |

| `partitioning_method` or `pm`       | `str`                 | `"conservative"` | Partitioning method: `balanced`, `conservative`, `equal`, `max`, `None`, or `all`. `all` runs the four partitioning methods in separate directories. When `CSV_input` is used, GenBank download/alignment is performed once and reused across the batch runs, the temporary cache is deleted afterward, and a top-level overall runtime log is written. |
| `partitioning_round` or `pr`        | `int` or `str`        | `0`              | Round or number of selected blocks used by `balanced`, `conservative`, or `equal` partitioning. Ranges such as `0-10` generate one run per round in separate directories. When `CSV_input` is used in batch mode, these runs reuse the same cached aligned FASTA files and still produce a root-level batch runtime log. |
| `partitioning_conservative` or `pc` | `str`                 | `"midpoint"`     | Placement mode for conservative partitioning: `midpoint` inserts one `#` in the middle of each selected invariant block, and `flank` inserts `#` columns around each selected invariant block. |
| `partitioning_max_size` or `pms`    | `int`                 | `None`           | Initial maximum partition size. If set, the alignment is first split into equal-length partitions of this size, and the selected partitioning method is then applied independently within each partition. |
| `partitioning_size` or `ps`         | `int`                 | `None`           | Size of equal-length partitions when `partitioning_method='equal'`. |
